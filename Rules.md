# Smallworld: Game Rules

## Turn Phases

### 1. Pick race/power combo
   - #### Phase preliminaries
     + Must be done if first turn of game for player
     + Must be done if in previous turn the player's race went into decline
   - #### Parts of phase
     1. Select a race/power combo (from list of 6)
     1. Pay VP for combos passed over
     1. Take all VP previously set on that combo
     1. Take correct number of race tokens
     1. Add new race/power combo to end of list (keep list at 6 options)
### 2a. Conquer regions
   - #### Phase preliminaries
     + Chosen instead of 2b
   - #### Parts of phase
     1. If player has the Ghouls race in decline, they conquer before anything done by the active race of the player
     1. If race is new (i.e. first conquest) must start in a border region (edges of board or sea)
     1. Take all active race tokens into hand, leaving one in each occupied region
        + The player may choose to abandon regions by taking the remaining token of that region, but that region no longer will count toward VP unless reconquered
        + If all regions are abandoned by the player, they must follow the rules of first conquest (border region)
     1. Conquer adjacent regions (see conquering later on for details)
     1. Redeploy troops
     1. All other players redeploy their conquered troops to regions they control
### 2b. Put race into decline
   - #### Phase preliminaries
     + Chosen instead of 2a
   - #### Parts of phase
     1. If the player already has 1 race in decline, the tokens of the previous race are completely removed from board
     1. All extra race tokens are taken from region, leaving only 1 in each region
### 3. Score VP
   - #### Phase preliminaries
     + Always performed
   - #### Parts of phase
     1. Tally total number of regions controlled by the player, both active and decline races; 1 VP each
     1. Calculate extra VP based on race and/or power of _active_ race

## Conquering
   - The first conquest must be done on a region bordering the edge of the board or sea
   - To conquer a region, the player must have:
     + Two available race tokens
     + One additional race token for each
       - Race token (including race in decline for player)
       - Trolls lair
       - Encampment
       - Fortress
       - Mountain
   - The player must deploy all the race tokens used to conquer the region into the conquered region, and they may not be used for the remainder of the conquering phase
     + If the conquered region was previously occupied by another player, the tokens occupying the region are returned to the player to be used in future conquests, except for one which is permanently discarded
     + After the current player has finished conquesting, the players whose regions have been conquered then redeploy their troops in their remaining regions
   - For the last conquest of the turn, as long as the player has **at least one unused race token**, they may select a region that would normally be **3 or less tokens to conquer**. They must declare it is their final conquest and which region they are attempting to conquer. They then roll the reinforcements die and combine the result with the number of their remaining unused race tokens. If the result is high enough to conquer the region, the region is conquered and the player puts the tokens used for conquering into that region. Otherwise the player continues on to troop redeployment as normal. The conquering phase ends.

## Races

**Amazons**: Four additional tokens are used in the conquering phase. When the conquering phase is over, the four extra tokens are not left to defend regions.  
**Dwarves**: Mine regions are worth 1 extra VP. This bonus stays even when in decline.  
**Elves**: When regions occupied by the elves are conquered, the player owning the elves takes back all tokens in the region without discarding one.  
**Ghouls**: When going into decline, excess tokens are not taken off of occupied regions. They may continue to conquer regions while in decline as though they were active.  
**Giants**: Giants conquer regions adjacent to mountain regions with 1 less token, with a minimum of 1 token.  
**Halflings**: Halflings do not need to enter at the border of the map for their first conquest. The first two regions they conquer receive an immunity bonus from other players wishing to conquer that region, and can't be conquered. The immunity goes away once the race enters decline, or the region is abandoned.  
**Humans**: Farmland regions are worth 1 extra VP.  
**Orcs**: Each non-empty region conquered is worth 1 extra VP at the end of the turn it was conquered.  
**Ratmen**: There's a metric crap-ton of Ratmen.  
**Skeletons**: During troop redeployment, Skeletons receive 1 extra race token for each 2 non-empty regions conquered this turn. If there are no remaining Skeleton tokens, no extra token is provided.  
**Sorcerers**: Once per turn _per opponent_, Sorcerers may conquer a region containing a single, active race token owned by an opponent by substituting it for one taken from the extra Sorcerer token stash. The conquered region must be adjacent to a region the Sorcerers occupy. The conquered token is not returned to the player it was taken from.  
**Tritons**: Tritons conquer regions adjacent to a sea or lake at 1 less token, with a minimum of 1 token.  
**Trolls**: Each region conquered by trolls gets one Troll lair token as extra defense. The lairs stay even when the Trolls enter decline. They're removed when the region is conquered or it is abandoned.  
**Wizards**: Magic regions are worth 1 extra VP.

## Powers

**Alchemist**: Collect 2 bonus VP at the end of each turn your race hasn't yet gone into decline.  
**Berserk**: You may use the reinforcement die before each conquest rather than just the final one. Minimum of 1 token is still required to attempt conquest. Place the required amount of tokens to conquer, minus the result of the die.  
**Bivouacking**: During troop redeployment, gain 5 encampment tokens to place to add to defense of your regions. Multiple tokens may be placed in the same region. During subsequent redeployment phases the encampments may be redistributed. When the associated race goes into decline they disappear.  
**Commando**: You may conquer any region with 1 less race token than normal, with a minimum of 1.  
**Diplomat**: At the end of your turn, you may choose one opponent whose active race you did not attack this turn. Their active race may not attack your active race during their turn. (If they have Ghouls in decline, they are exempt from this)  
**Dragon Master**: Once per turn you may conquer a region using a single race token. Once conquered place your Dragon token there. The region with a dragon token are immune to conquests as well as special powers from races or powers. The dragon disappears when the race goes into decline.  
**Flying**: Regions you conquer do not need to be adjacent to ones you already occupy. Does not allow conquering of sea/lake regions.  
**Forest**: Collect 1 bonus VP for each forest region you control at the end of your turn.  
**Fortified**: Once per turn, as long as the race is active, a fortress token may be placed in a region you occupy that doesn't already contain a fortress. Fortresses give 1 bonus VP at the end of the turn for your active race. They do not go away when the race goes into decline but they no longer provide VP.  
**Heroic**: At the end of the turn, place the 2 hero tokens in 2 different regions you occupy. These regions are immune to conquest and special or race powers.  
**Hill**: Collect 1 bonus VP for each hill region you control at the end of your turn.  
**Merchant**: Collect 1 bonus VP for any region you occupy at the end of your turn.  
**Mounted**: Hill and Farmland regions are conquered with 1 less race token than normal, with a minimum of 1.  
**Pillaging**: Each non-empty region you conquer this turn is worth 1 bonus VP at the end of your turn.  
**Seafaring**: You may conquer the seas and the lake, considering them as empty regions.  
**Spirit**: The associated race does not adhere to the only 1 race in decline limit.  
**Stout**: You may go into decline at the end of a regular turn of conquests and after scoring.  
**Swamp**: Collect 1 bonus VP for each swamp region you control at the end of your turn.  
**Underworld**: You may conquer any region with a cavern with 1 less race token than normal, with a minimum of 1. Regions with tunnels are considered adjacent to each other for conquest purposes.  
**Wealthy**: Collect 7 bonus VP once only at the end of your first turn.
